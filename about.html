      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h3>Ingomso was founded by Kanyisile Mzondo, a queer youth from the deep rural areas of Dutywa in a village called Jozana. Kanyisile first figured it out when she was in varsity that she was bisexual. She knew that if it had taken her this this long to figure out her sexuality, there were many more in the same position as her still trying to figure out why they feel the way they do. She then came up with the idea of starting a youth center where the LBGTQ+ youth would come together and create a safe space for themselves. A home away from home. 
          Here at Ingomso we provide group therapy as well as individual therapy to troubled youth in the LGBTQ+ community. We believe that through improve mental health our youth can see life in a better light and be able to withstand whatever life throws at them.
