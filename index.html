      Welcome to our page! Here  at Ingomso we are a non-profit organisation that helps the youth in the LGBTQ+ community navigate life in our society. The LGBTQ+ youth is 1.5 -3 times more likely to attempt suicide compared to the heterosexual youth. This is mostly due to the homophobia and transphobia that they experience in their communities as well as their homes. This is the driving force behind Ingomso, to try and reduce these numbers through group therapy as well as individual sessions for the queer youth coming from disadvantaged areas. Ingomso’s purpose is to be a haven for the young queer folk, for them to find each and know that there are people like them and experience the same things.

<h1>Events</h1>
<h3>
Here at Ingomso we host different events throughout the year which include fundraisers and family days. We also take in other events the biggest one being the Pride. Pride is a parade event that takes place annually in June. Pride commemorates the Stonewall riots which took place on the 28 June 1969 which was due to the unlawful raids by the police at the gay bar Stonewall Inn. The gay community took a stand against the discrimination they were experiencing from the police and everyone else around. They were led by Marsha P. Henson and their good friend Sylvia Rivera. Years after the riots Pride meant that people would celebrate their coming out and living their truth as well as celebrating their individual freedom. This is what we want for our youth here at Ingomso, for them to celebrate their lives everyday knowing that there’s a whole community of people just like them rooting for them.
